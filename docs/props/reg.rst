===================

.. note:: Any properties not explicitly listed here are either implicitly
    supported, or are not relevant to the regblock exporter and are ignored.

accesswidth
-----------
|NO|

Only ``accesswidth`` that is equal to the ``regwidth`` is supported (default if unset)

regwidth
--------
|OK|

Control the bit-width of the register.
