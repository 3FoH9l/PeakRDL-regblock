================================================================================
Things that need validation by the compiler
================================================================================
Many of these are probably already covered, but being paranoid.
Make a list of things as I think of them.

Mark these as follows:
    X = Yes, confirmed that the compiler covers this
    ! = No! Confirmed that the compiler does not check this
    (blank) = TBD

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

X resetsignal width
    reset signals shall have width of 1

X Field has no knowable value
    - does not implement storage
    - hw is not writable
    - sw is readable
    - No reset value specified

    --> emit a warning?

! multiple field_reset in the same hierarchy
    there can only be one signal declared with field_reset
    in a given hierarchy

! multiple cpuif_reset in the same hierarchy
    there can only be one signal declared with cpuif_reset
    in a given hierarchy

! incrwidth/incrvalue & decrvalue/decrwidth
    these pairs are mutually exclusive.
    Make sure they are not both set after elaboration
    Compiler checks for mutex within the same scope, but
    i dont think I check for mutexes post-elaborate

    ... or, make these properties clear each-other on assignment

================================================================================
Things that need validation by this exporter
================================================================================
List of stuff in case I forget.

    ! = No! exporter does not enforce this yet
    x = Yes! I already implemented this.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
! "bridge" addrmap not supported
    export shall refuse to process an addrmap marked as a "bridge"
    Only need to check top-level. Compiler will enforce that child nodes arent bridges

cpuif_resets
    ! Warn/error on any signal with cpuif_reset set, that is not in the top-level
        addrmap. At the very least, warn that it will be ignored

    ! multiple cpuif_reset
        there can be only one cpuif reset
